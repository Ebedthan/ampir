Description: A toolkit to predict antimicrobial peptides from protein sequences on a genome-wide scale.
    It incorporates a support vector machine model trained on publicly available antimicrobial peptide data using calculated
    physico-chemical and compositional sequence properties described in Meher et al. (2017) <doi:10.1038/srep42362>.
    In order to support genome-wide analyses this model is designed to accept any type of protein as input
    and calculation of physico-chemical properties has been optimised for high-throughput use.
