\title{Predict the antimicrobial peptide probability of a protein}
\usage{
rsvm_classify(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing numerical features (as calculated by \code{calculate_features})}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing a single column with probability values

# example

# my_protein_features <- readRDS(system.file("extdata/my_protein_features.rds", package = "ampir"))

rsvm_classify(my_protein_features)
#       seq_name    prob_AMP
# [1] G1P6H5_MYOLU  0.9723796
}
\description{
This function predicts the probability of a protein to be an antimicrobial peptide based on feature calculations (as obtained from \code{calculate_features})
}
\note{
The predictive model within this function was created via the caret package (https://github.com/topepo/caret/)
}
