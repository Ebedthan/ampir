\title{Calculate a set of numerical features from protein sequences}
\usage{
calculate_features(df, min_len = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe which contains protein sequence names as the first column and amino acid sequence as the second column}

\item{min_len}{Minimum length sequence for which features can be calculated. It is an error to provide sequences with length shorter than this}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing numerical values related to the protein features of each given protein

# example

# my_protein <- readRDS(system.file("extdata/my_protein_df.rds", package = "ampir"))

# Calculate features from Hepcidin AMP from \emph{Myotis lucifugus} (UniProt ID G1P6H5)

# calculate_features(my_protein)

## Output (showing the first six output columns)
#      seq_name     Amphiphilicity  Hydrophobicity     pI          Mw       Charge    ....
# [1] G1P6H5_MYOLU	   0.4145847       0.4373494     8.501312     9013.757   4.53015   ....
